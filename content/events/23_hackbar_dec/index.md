# Intro 
The hackbar.ch event is focused on (cyber-)security and the <3 for computers. Everybody is welcome.

# What
Initially, the idea was to meet up to watch live-streams of the yearly [Chaos Communication Congress (CCC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress) together.
The tradition of watching the CCC streams together grew in popularity, more friends joined, and now we want to make it an open event.
Everybody is welcome to join the event. The bar is stocked with club-mate and [tschunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tschunk).
